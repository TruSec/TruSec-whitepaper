\newglossaryentry{prompt_charge}
{
        name=prompt charge,
        description={The charge that is collected by means of funnelling.} % TODO: verify whether this lose interpretation of:
        %A large fraction of the total charge collected by the circuit node occurs in time periods of about 200 ps, and this is referred to as prompt charge. There is also a delayed component that is collected by diffusion. The delayed component can extend to 1 Âµs or longer,[2] and is important for slower SEE phenomena such as upset in dynamic memories, and latchup.

	abstract = {Deep neural networks are highly expressive models that have recently achieved state of the art performance on speech and visual recognition tasks. While their expressiveness is the reason they succeed, it also causes them to learn uninterpretable solutions that could have counter-intuitive properties. In this paper we report two such properties. First, we find that there is no distinction between individual high level units and random linear combinations of high level units, according to various methods of unit analysis. It suggests that it is the space, rather than the individual units, that contains of the semantic information in the high layers of neural networks. Second, we find that deep neural networks learn input-output mappings that are fairly discontinuous to a significant extend. We can cause the network to misclassify an image by applying a certain imperceptible perturbation, which is found by maximizing the network's prediction error. In addition, the specific nature of these perturbations is not a random artifact of learning: the same perturbation can cause a different network, that was trained on a different subset of the dataset, to misclassify the same input.},

Methods: Subjects were six patients who had sustained a moderate to severe TBI about four years before scanning and had since made a good recovery. Eleven healthy young adults matched to the patients for age and education served as controls. An established H2150 positron emission tomography paradigm was used to elicit brain activations in response to memory retrieval. TBI patients' patterns of brain activation were compared statistically with those of control subjects. Both group and individual case data were analysed. Results: Both TBI patients and controls engaged frontal, temporal, and parietal regions known to be involved in memory retrieval, yet the TBI patients showed relative increases in frontal, anterior cingulate, and occipital activity. The hemispheric asymmetry characteristic of controls was attenuated in patients with TBI. Reduced activation was noted in the right dorsomedial thalamus. Although local aspects of this pattern were affected by the presence of focal lesions and performance differences, the overall pattern was reliable across patients and comparable to functional neuroimaging results reported for normal aging, Alzheimer's disease, and other patients with TBI. Conclusions: The TBI patients performed memory tasks using altered functional neuroanatomical networks. These changes are probably the result of diffuse axonal injury and may reflect either cortical disinhibition attributable to disconnection or compensation for inefficient mnemonic processes.},

              This work investigates network organisation of brain structural connectivity in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) relative to healthy controls and its putative association with lesion distribution and disease indicators.
            
            
              Methods
              White matter hyperintensity (WMH) segmentation and connectomics were performed in 47 patients with SLE and 47 healthy age-matched controls from structural and diffusion MRI data. Network nodes were divided into hierarchical tiers based on numbers of connections. Results were compared between patients and controls to assess for differences in brain network organisation. Voxel-based analyses of the spatial distribution of WMH in relation to network measures and SLE disease indicators were conducted.
            
            
              Results
              Despite inter-individual differences in brain network organization observed across the study sample, the connectome networks of SLE patients had larger proportion of connections in the peripheral nodes. SLE patients had statistically larger numbers of links in their networks with generally larger fractional anisotropy weights (i.e. a measure of white matter integrity) and less tendency to aggregate than those of healthy controls. The voxels exhibiting connectomic differences were coincident with WMH clusters, particularly the left hemisphere’s intersection between the anterior limb of the internal and external capsules. Moreover, these voxels also associated more strongly with disease indicators.
            
            
              Conclusion
              Our results indicate network differences reflective of compensatory reorganization of the neural circuits, reflecting adaptive or extended neuroplasticity in SLE.},

	abstract = {Deep neural networks are vulnerable to adversarial examples, which dramatically alter model output using small input changes. We propose Neural Fingerprinting, a simple, yet effective method to detect adversarial examples by verifying whether model behavior is consistent with a set of secret fingerprints, inspired by the use of biometric and cryptographic signatures. The benefits of our method are that 1) it is fast, 2) it is prohibitively expensive for an attacker to reverse-engineer which fingerprints were used, and 3) it does not assume knowledge of the adversary. In this work, we pose a formal framework to analyze fingerprints under various threat models, and characterize Neural Fingerprinting for linear models. For complex neural networks, we empirically demonstrate that Neural Fingerprinting significantly improves on state-of-the-art detection mechanisms by detecting the strongest known adversarial attacks with 98-100\% AUC-ROC scores on the MNIST, CIFAR-10 and MiniImagenet (20 classes) datasets. In particular, the detection accuracy of Neural Fingerprinting generalizes well to unseen test-data under various black- and whitebox threat models, and is robust over a wide range of hyperparameters and choices of fingerprints.},

	abstract = {Deep neural networks (DNNs) have been found to be vulnerable to adversarial examples resulting from adding small-magnitude perturbations to inputs. Such adversarial examples can mislead DNNs to produce adversary-selected results. Different attack strategies have been proposed to generate adversarial examples, but how to produce them with high perceptual quality and more efficiently requires more research efforts. In this paper, we propose AdvGAN to generate adversarial examples with generative adversarial networks (GANs), which can learn and approximate the distribution of original instances. For AdvGAN, once the generator is trained, it can generate adversarial perturbations efficiently for any instance, so as to potentially accelerate adversarial training as defenses. We apply AdvGAN in both semi-whitebox and black-box attack settings. In semi-whitebox attacks, there is no need to access the original target model after the generator is trained, in contrast to traditional white-box attacks. In black-box attacks, we dynamically train a distilled model for the black-box model and optimize the generator accordingly. Adversarial examples generated by AdvGAN on different target models have high attack success rate under state-of-the-art defenses compared to other attacks. Our attack has placed the first with 92.76\% accuracy on a public MNIST black-box attack challenge.},

Different attack strategies have been proposed to generate adversarial examples, but how to produce them with high perceptual quality and more efficiently requires more research efforts. In this paper, we propose AdvGAN to generate adversarial examples with generative adversarial networks (GANs), which can learn and approximate the distribution of original instances. For AdvGAN, once the generator is trained, it can generate adversarial perturbations efficiently for any instance, so as to potentially accelerate adversarial training as defenses. We apply AdvGAN in both semi-whitebox and black-box attack settings. In semi-whitebox attacks, there is no need to access the original target model after the generator is trained, in contrast to traditional white-box attacks. In black-box attacks, we dynamically train a distilled model for the black-box model and optimize the generator accordingly. Adversarial examples generated by AdvGAN on different target models have high attack success rate under state-of-the-art defenses compared to other attacks. Our attack has placed the first with 92.76\% accuracy on a public MNIST black-box attack challenge.},

	abstract = {Much of studies on neural computation are based on network models of static neurons that produce analog output, despite the fact that information processing in the brain is predominantly carried out by dynamic neurons that produce discrete pulses called spikes. Research in spike-based computation has been impeded by the lack of efficient supervised learning algorithm for spiking networks. Here, we present a gradient descent method for optimizing spiking network models by introducing a differentiable formulation of spiking networks and deriving the exact gradient calculation. For demonstration, we trained recurrent spiking networks on two dynamic tasks: one that requires optimizing fast ({\textasciitilde}millisecond) spike-based interactions for efficient encoding of information, and a delayed memory XOR task over extended duration ({\textasciitilde}second). The results show that our method indeed optimizes the spiking network dynamics on the time scale of individual spikes as well as behavioral time scales. In conclusion, our result offers a general purpose supervised learning algorithm for spiking neural networks, thus advancing further investigations on spike-based computation.},

So far, the attempts to correlate cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) levels with measures of aggression have revealed inverse, direct, or no correlations in different nonhuman primate species. It is difficult to harmonize the occasional correlations between CSF 5-HIAA and adaptive aggressive acts in nonhuman primates (a) with clinically diagnosed suicidal or impulsive individuals, and (b) with the biochemical, anatomical, and presumably functional differentiation of 5-HT pathways and receptor subtypes. Eltoprazine, a mixed 5-HT1A/B agonist, and meta-trifluoro-methylphenyl-piperazine HCl (TFMPP), a more selective 5-HT1B agonist, specifically decrease aggressive behavior in several animal species and situations in both sexes without detriment to other social, exploratory, or motoric activities. A definite role for 5-HT1A, 5-HT2, and 5-HT3 receptor subtypes in the mechanisms mediating aggressive behaviors has to await the development of selective agonists and antagonists, respectively.},

This work presents such a translation of a distributed approximation algorithm for the minimum dominating set problem, as described by Kuhn and Wattenhofer (2005), to a spiking neural network. This translation shows that neuromorphic architectures can be used to implement distributed algorithms. Subcomponents of this implementation, such as the calculation of the minimum or maximum of two numbers and degree of a node, can be reused as foundational building blocks for other (graph) algorithms. This work illustrates how leveraging neural properties for the translation of traditional algorithms relies on novel insights, thereby contributing to a growing body of knowledge on neuromorphic applications for scientific computing.},

	abstract = {For a biological agent operating under environmental pressure, energy consumption and reaction times are of critical importance. Similarly, engineered systems are optimized for short time-to-solution and low energy-to-solution characteristics. At the level of neuronal implementation, this implies achieving the desired results with as few and as early spikes as possible. With time-to-first-spike coding both of these goals are inherently emerging features of learning. Here, we describe a rigorous derivation of a learning rule for such first-spike times in networks of leaky integrate-and-fire neurons, relying solely on input and output spike times, and show how this mechanism can implement error backpropagation in hierarchical spiking networks. Furthermore, we emulate our framework on the BrainScaleS-2 neuromorphic system and demonstrate its capability of harnessing the system's speed and energy characteristics. Finally, we examine how our approach generalizes to other neuromorphic platforms by studying how its performance is affected by typical distortive effects induced by neuromorphic substrates.},

Yet, to solve real-world problems, these networks need to be trained. However, training on neuromorphic substrates creates significant challenges due to the offline character and the required nonlocal computations of gradient-based learning algorithms. This article provides a mathematical framework for the design of practical online learning algorithms for neuromorphic substrates. Specifically, we show a direct connection between real-time recurrent learning (RTRL), an online algorithm for computing gradients in conventional recurrent neural networks (RNNs), and biologically plausible learning rules for training spiking neural networks (SNNs). Furthermore, we motivate a sparse approximation based on block-diagonal Jacobians, which reduces the algorithm's computational complexity, diminishes the nonlocal information requirements, and empirically leads to good learning performance, thereby improving its applicability to neuromorphic substrates. In summary, our framework bridges the gap between synaptic plasticity and gradient-based approaches from deep learning and lays the foundations for powerful information processing on future neuromorphic hardware systems.},

            Resilience and adaptation in the face of early genetic or environmental risk has become a major interest in child psychiatry over recent years. However, we still remain far from an understanding of how developing human brains as a whole adapt to the diffuse and widespread atypical synaptic function that may be characteristic of some common developmental disorders. The first part of this paper discusses four types of whole-brain adaptation in the face of early risk: redundancy, reorganization, niche construction, and adjustment of developmental rate. The second part of the paper applies these adaptation processes specifically to autism. We speculate that key features of autism may be the end result of processes of early brain adaptation, rather than the direct consequences of ongoing neural pathology.},

	abstract = {\&lt;p\&gt;EnVision is a proposed orbiter mission aiming at determining the nature and current state of Venus' geological evolution and its relationship with the atmosphere, to understand how and why Venus and Earth evolved so differently. It is is one of two M5 mission concepts in Phase A study with a final down-selection expected in June 2021. EnVision\&amp;\#8217;s overall science goals are\&lt;br /\&gt;\&lt;br /\&gt;- to\&amp;\#160;\&lt;strong\&gt;characterise\&lt;/strong\&gt;\&amp;\#160;the sequence of events that generated the regional and global surface features of Venus, and characterize the geodynamics framework that controls the release of internal heat over Venus history;\&amp;\#160;\&lt;br /\&gt;\&lt;br /\&gt;-\&amp;\#160;to\&lt;strong\&gt;\&amp;\#160;search\&lt;/strong\&gt;\&amp;\#160;for ongoing geological processes and determine\&lt;strong\&gt;\&amp;\#160;\&lt;/strong\&gt;whether the planet is active in the present era;\&lt;br /\&gt;\&lt;br /\&gt;-\&amp;\#160;to\&amp;\#160;\&lt;strong\&gt;characterise\&lt;/strong\&gt;\&amp;\#160;regional and local geological units, to better assess whether Venus once had condensed liquid water on its surface and was thus perhaps hospitable for life in its early history.\&lt;br /\&gt;\&lt;br /\&gt;EnVision will deliver new insights into geological history through complementary imagery, polarimetry, radiometry and spectroscopy of the surface coupled with subsurface sounding and gravity mapping; it will search for thermal, morphological, and gaseous signs of volcanic and other geological activity; and it will trace the fate of key volatile species from their sources and sinks at the surface through the clouds up to the mesosphere.\&lt;br /\&gt;\&lt;br /\&gt;EnVision\&amp;\#8217;s science payload consists of VenSAR, a dual polarization S-band radar also operating as microwave radiometer, three spectrometers VenSpec-M, VenSpec-U and VenSpec-H designed to observe the surface and atmosphere of Venus, and the Subsurface Radar Sounder (SRS), a High Frequency (HF) sounding radar to probe the subsurface. These are complemented by a radio science investigation which achieves gravity mapping and radio occultation of the atmosphere, for a comprehensive investigation of the Venusian surface, interior and atmosphere and their interactions.\&lt;/p\&gt;},

We construct networks of spiking neurons that simulate arbitrary threshold circuits, Turing machines, and a certain type of random access machines with real valued inputs. We also show that relatively weak basic assumptions about the response and threshold functions of the spiking neurons are sufficient to employ them for such computations.},

            Bronson (1974) reviewed evidence in support of the claim that the development of visually guided behavior in the human infant over the first few months of life represents a shift from subcortical to cortical visual processing. Recently, this view has been brought into question for two reasons; first, evidence revealing apparently sophisticated perceptual abilities in the newborn, and second, increasing evidence for multiple cortica streams of visual processing. The present paper presents a reanalysis of the relation between the maturation of cortical pathways and the development of visually guided behavior, focusing in particular on how the maturational state of the primary visual cortex may constrain the functioning of neural pathways subserving oculomotor control.},

	abstract = {A Van Allen radiation belt is a zone of energetic charged particles, most of which originate from the solar wind, that are captured by and held around a planet by that planet's magnetosphere. Earth has two such belts, and sometimes others may be temporarily created. The belts are named after James Van Allen, who is credited with their discovery. Earth's two main belts extend from an altitude of about 640 to 58,000 km (400 to 36,040 mi) above the surface, in which region radiation levels vary. Most of the particles that form the belts are thought to come from solar wind and other particles by cosmic rays. By trapping the solar wind, the magnetic field deflects those energetic particles and protects the atmosphere from destruction. The belts are in the inner region of Earth's magnetic field. The belts trap energetic electrons and protons. Other nuclei, such as alpha particles, are less prevalent. The belts endanger satellites, which must have their sensitive components protected with adequate shielding if they spend significant time near that zone. In 2013, NASA reported that the Van Allen Probes had discovered a transient, third radiation belt, which was observed for four weeks until it was destroyed by a powerful, interplanetary shock wave from the Sun. The 1963-1990 Universal Logo had Van Allen belts inside the globe.},

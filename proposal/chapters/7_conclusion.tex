\section{Conclusion and Recommendations}
\label{sec:conclusion}
The proposed protocol may enable companies to convey the level of security of (segments of) their open source technology stack more intuitively to their customers/stakeholders. Additionally, the protocol enables whitehat/ethical hackers to retrieve payouts directly without ambiguity. 

The development of the protocol requires significant work, and it is currently not clear what the added value of the protocol would be in real-life settings. A presentation of the protocol, without working implementation, in the \textit{Policy Track} of the Blackhat (USA) 2022 edition may be a direct probe to the cyber-security world to assess the interest in actually implementing the protocol.

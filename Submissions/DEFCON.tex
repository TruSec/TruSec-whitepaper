%NEW! What do you bring to the table, how will you or your presentation(s) contribute a new perspective to the content at DEF CON? (Please answer for each speaker &/or panel members.)
We intend to present a protocol that can improve 3 aspects of vulnerability disclosures:
0. Ambiguity is removed in bounty payouts to ethical hackers for deterministically verifiable zero-day exploits.
1. Companies gain quantitative insight in the level of security of staked open source stacks against zero-day exploits.
2. Manual labour of cybersecurity triage can be eliminated for deterministically verifiable zero-day exploits.

We will use the email addresses you included on your application (unless stated otherwise). DEF CON staff, and other speakers would be able to see your email address once you accepted the invitation. Yes/No
Yes
%PRESENTATION INFORMATION
%Date of Submission:
2022-03-19

%Presentation Title:
Eliminating triage intermediaries for zero-day exploits using a decentralised payout protocol.

%Length of presentation: (20 minutes, 45 minutes, 105 minutes)
%Please note: We accept few 105 minute talks, your submission will need to breakdown the time requested within your content outline.
20 minutes

%Is there a demonstration? Yes or No. If yes, please explain the demonstration.
No
%Is there audience participation*? Yes or No. If yes, how?
No
%Are you releasing a new tool? Yes or No
No
%If you are releasing a new tool:
%Under which license?
The presented protocol is proposed to be implemented using fully open source code.

We present a protocol without implementation.
%Is the tool currently public?
A whitepaper will be publicised. % TODO: include reference to attachment.
%What language is the tool written in?
Not applicable.
%Please introduce your tool briefly and explain what it does:
The protocol allows companies to stake decentralised virtual machines with open source software stacks, whilst allowing hackers to deploy an attack to those decentralised VM's and automatically retrieve the bounty.

Blackhat USA 2022. August 6-11.

%Are you submitting this or any other topic to Black Hat USA? Yes or No. If Yes, please elaborate.
Yes, for hackers to maximally benefit from this protocol, we need adoption of large companies, hence, we also aim to present this protocol to enterprise at blackhat.

%If you answered yes to the previous question, can you ONLY commit to speak at DEF CON if your talk is accepted at Black Hat USA? Yes or No
No
%Note: For clarification, this means if your submission to Black Hat's CFP is rejected, you plan to withdraw your DEF CON Submission.

%Are you submitting this or any other topic to BSidesLV? Yes or No. If Yes, please elaborate.
No

%Sometimes a good CFP makes a great fit for a DEF CON Village too. The review board will recommend some talks to be presented exclusively in a village, or as an encore to a main stage presentation. Do you consent to allow DEF CON to forward your completed submission to relevant DEF CON Village lead(s) for their consideration for village content? * Yes or No.
Yes

%ABSTRACT
%(not to exceed 1337 characters):
We present a protocol that collectivises security bounties for deterministically verifiable zero-day exploits(DVZEs). It helps hackers retrieve bounties without ambiguity and removes subjectivity and manual labour of triage processes for those bounties. Companies can show customers how secure their open source software is, in terms of dollars staked on the software.

Companies and users can pool bounties on open-source security stacks in decentralised virtual machines (DVMs) that contain a read and/or write secret. They can also specify a minimum responsible disclosure duration as well as a public key. Next, hackers can submit an attack to such a DVM, by storing it in a decentralised encrypted locker (DEL), and notify the DVM of its presence. Once the stakeholders see this notification, (along with the rest of the world), they can use their private key to retrieve the attack from the DEL (before the rest of the world). For each bounty placed on the DVM, a call is made to the DEL just before the end of the accompanying responsible disclosure time. This call verifies that the attack is still encrypted. After the respective responsible disclosure periods have passed, the DEL is decrypted and the attack is executed. Successful attacks compromise the DVM read/write secret, triggering bounty hunter payout.

%Note: Your abstract will be used for the website and printed materials. Summarize what your presentation will cover. Attendees will read this to get an idea of what they should know before your presentation, and what they will learn after. Use this to inform attendees about how technical your talk is, what tools will be used, what materials to read in advance to get the most out of your presentation. This abstract is the primary way people will be drawn to your session, but should not give them the entire content of the talk. We request you keep your abstract well over 140 characters, but at or under the 1337 maximum.

%SPEAKER BIO(S)
%(not to exceed 1337 characters total):
A motivated student with an interdisciplinary bachelor in artificial intelligence and philosophy at the Liberal Arts & Sciences faculty of Utrecht University. Victoria currently works on a master in Artificial Intelligence with a specialisation in cognitive computing at Radboud University. She has a passion for making science accessible and works on science outreach as the editor in chief at De Focus‚Äù - an online platform for scientific journalism. Besides her studies, she worked on, and presented the TruCol protocol during the Ethereum conference in Paris last summer. Additionally, she co-authored the 2021 publication titled: "Implementation of a distributed minimum dominating set approximation algorithm in a spiking neural network".

%Note: This text will be used for the website and printed materials and should be written in the third person. Cover any professional or hacker history that is relevant to you and the presentation, you may include past jobs, tools that you have written, etc. Let people know who you are and why you are qualified to speak on your topic. If you prefer, you may write your bio under a pseudonym. Please include Co-Speaker and Panel Bios when possible.

%REFERENCES:
%Please provide a simple bibliography and/or works cited. List sources you have used (whether referenced or not) in the process of finalizing your presentation. Please remember to credit prior works and acknowledge others. References will be posted online with your talk information. We want attendees interested in your talk to be able to research what has been helpful for you in developing this presentation.
The protocol was derived from TruCol which can be inspected at https://github.com/TruCol
%
%DETAILED OUTLINE:
%Note: This is the most important section on the application. You must provide a detailed outline containing the main points and navigation through your talk - show how you intend to begin, where you intend to lead the audience and how you plan to get there. Your outline should be in simple text. Please do not submit slides, Docs, or PDFs as an outline. If you are submitting a panel, it‚Äôs encouraged to list what each panel member will contribute to on the outline, as well as the estimated time budgeted for those bullet points. The review board likes submissions that include references to prior works and research you used in developing your presentation. The more detailed your outline then the better we are able to review your presentation against other submissions (and the higher chance you have of being accepted).
I. State assumptions: 
A. Mention why we assume the world could benefit from seeing how much money is staked on the security of all open source software stacks. 
B. Indicate we assume that some ethical hackers may experience some difficulties in retrieving their payout as part of a responsible disclosure protocol.
II. Indicate this presentation merely presents a protocol, not an implementation.
III. Mention the protocol is intended to be open source.
IV. Explain protocol using with visualisation of stakeholder and hacker interaction on the decentralised network.
% TODO: make detailed.
VI. Cover protocol attacks by malicious actors, and accompanying incentives.
% TODO: make detailed.
VII. Mention weaknesses of protocol: 
A. Anyone can see that a zero-day exists (not what it is). 
B. Limited vulnerability scope due to deterministic verifiability requirement. 
C. May incentivise companies to convey a false sense of security by overemphasising the numbers, instead of providing a full thread-landscape picture that includes misconfigurations, supply-chain attacks, social engineering etc.
VII. Summarise based on which assumptions this protocol can improve market efficiency for deterministically verifiable zero-day exploit disclosures. 
IX. Propose strategy to move forward to implementation.
IIX. Ask critical feedback/questions/suggestions.

%WHY DEF CON?:
%Note: This is your opportunity to directly address the DEF CON review board as to why you think your talk is good for our hacker con. More and more we are seeing submissions that are well suited for cyber security industry conferences, developer conferences, or local meetups but may not align with the board's view of the DEF CON spirit. The bumper sticker "Keep Infosec out of Hacking" comes to mind. We get many great submissions but they aren't always aimed at the 30,000 hackers at our con. This frequently results in the review board saying "Unfortunately, this is not a DEF CON talk". DEF CON is a hacking con, so how does your content fit in to that culture, spirit, and subject matter?
%
We hope to make the life of hackers a bit simpler. In particular, there is no more discontent about triage, there is no question on legality, attacks can be submitted anonymously, and there are no more employees of companies that need to be convinced of the importance/impact of the vulnerability after discovery.
Additionally, we hope that wide-scale adoption of this protocol shows the world that the security of open source software against zero-day exploits, is only as strong as its weakest link, by repeatedly putting a price tag on that weakest link. Such a price tag may make it easier for companies to allocate (more) funds into cybersecurity, we hope some of these funds eventually reach (more) hackers.

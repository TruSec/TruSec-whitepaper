\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}
This document presents a Trustless Security protocol that aims to help ethical hackers retrieve zero-day exploit bounties without ambiguity, whilst simultaneously enabling companies to show their customers how much money is staked on their open source software stacks.


To explain how the protocol may help both of these stakeholders (ethical hackers and companies using open source software), we will first describe, what we think is, a typical procedure for vulnerability disclosures in \cref{sec:assumptions}. Then we will explain how the protocol can improve upon that in \cref{sec:protocol}. Next, \cref{sec:implementation} describes strategies to specify how the protocol may be implemented. The limitations and weaknesses of our strategy and protocol are detailed in \cref{sec:discussion}. This white-paper is concluded in \cref{sec:conclusion}.

\section{Conclusion and Recommendations}
\label{sec:conclusion}
The proposed protocol can enable companies to convey a quantitative level of security of (segments of) their open source technology stack to their customers. Customers can use this information on the minimum price for zero-day exploits, and compare it to their costs of suffering from a malicious zero-day exploit. This may allow them to (re)allocate their funds and cyber-security resources based on the accompanying risk-profile that emerges after multiple patching cycles with the TruSec protocol. 

Additionally, the protocol enables ethical hackers to retrieve payouts directly without ambiguity.

Since computational budgets typically are costly on decentralised computing platforms, a recommendation is included to investigate the option to allow staking decentralised containerized applications instead of complete decentralised virtual machines.

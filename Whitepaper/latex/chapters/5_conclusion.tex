\section{Conclusion and Recommendations}
\label{sec:conclusion}
The proposed protocol can enable companies to convey a quantitative level of security of (segments of) their open source technology stack their customers. Customers can use this information on the minimum price for zero-day exploit, and compare it to their costs of suffering from a malicious zero-day exploit. This may allow them to (re)allocate their funds and cyber-security resources based on the accompanying risk-profile. 

The Additionally, the protocol enables whitehat/ethical hackers to retrieve payouts directly without ambiguity.
